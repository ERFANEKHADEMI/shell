Drop Shadow
===========

These are a couple of simple QML files that make a dropshadow with
8dp elevation and 24dp elevation.

Run each QML file with the `qml` command and make a screenshot of it.
Then open the screenshot with an image editor and cut the purple part.
Save the resulting image into `src/compositor/images/chrome`.
